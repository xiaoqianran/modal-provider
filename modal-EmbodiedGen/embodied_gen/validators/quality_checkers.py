            - grasp_scenarios: each scenario must be concrete and plausible for the part. Confidence values must be consistent with how likely or useful that grasp is; high confidence should be reserved for common, robust grasps, while marginal or delicate grasps should have low confidence.
            - functional_labels: labels must describe real functions, roles, or possible uses of that physical part. They should not be generic, unrelated, or copied from another part.
            - semantic_description: it must match the RGB appearance of the same part, including visible color, material, surface finish, texture, shape, size, position, and markings when these can be inferred. The visible color means the real color in Image 1, not the segmentation mask color in Image 2.

            - Image 1: an RGB multi-view grid of the object.
            - Image 2: part mask multi-view grid aligned with Image 1. Different colors indicate different segmented parts.

            The goal is to judge whether Image 2 correctly segments the object into functional physical parts. A functional part is a region that has a distinct physical role or affordance for the object category, such as a handle, lid, wheel, leg, blade, screen, button, base, stem, cap, seat, backrest, or main body.

            Criteria:
            - Use Image 1 to understand the real object shape and functional parts.
            - Use Image 2 and the mask color list to identify which segmented regions exist. Only refer to colors from the provided color list.
            - Meaningful functional parts should be separated when their boundary is visually clear.
            - For simple single-piece categories with few mechanical parts, accept stable fine-grained regions that follow visible geometry or usable surfaces, even if they share the same broad function.
            - A single functional part should not appear as many small fragments or several colors unless those pieces are genuinely separate repeated parts.
            - Different functional parts should not be merged into one color when they have clear boundaries and different roles.
            - Ignore tiny boundary noise, minor holes, occluded-view ambiguity, and reasonable simplification for smooth objects with few natural parts.

            When the result is too fragmented, give modification advice that can be applied by code. The only supported modification is merging multiple mask colors into one functional part:
            - merge colors that belong to the same functional part.
            - merge small noisy fragments into the neighboring major color only when they are not meaningful functional parts.
            - For simple single-piece objects, prefer keeping coherent fine regions separate unless the colors are clearly accidental fragments of the same visible surface.
            - keep repeated symmetric parts separate only if the downstream task needs individual instances; otherwise they may share one color when they have the same function.
            - Do not suggest any operation other than color merging.

            - If the part segmentation is accurate enough, respond exactly with: YES
            - If the part segmentation is not accurate enough, respond with exactly one line starting with "NO: " followed by valid compact JSON.
            - The JSON must follow this schema:
              {{"summary":"brief reason","merge_groups":[{{"colors":["ColorName"],"target_part":"functional part name","reason":"why these colors should be merged"}}]}}
            - Each merge group must contain at least two colors from the provided mask color list.
            - Only include merge groups that are clearly supported by the images.

            You will be given:
            - A text description of an object: TEXT
            - Rendered views of the generated 3D asset.

            Your task is to:
            1. Determine whether the generated 3D asset roughly reflects the object class
                or a semantically adjacent category described in the text.
            2. Evaluate the geometry quality of the 3D asset generation based on the rendered views.

            Criteria:
            - Determine if the generated 3D asset belongs to the text described or a similar category.
            - Focus on functional similarity: if the object serves the same general
                purpose (e.g., writing, placing items), it should be accepted.
            - Is the geometry complete and well-formed, with no missing parts,
            distortions, visual artifacts, or redundant structures?
            - Does the number of object instances match the description?
                There should be only one object unless otherwise specified.
            - Minor flaws in geometry or texture are acceptable, high tolerance for texture quality defects.
            - Minor simplifications in geometry or texture (e.g. soft edges, less detail)
                are acceptable if the object is still recognizable.
            - The asset should not contain any unrelated elements, such as
                ground planes, platforms, or background props (e.g., paper, flooring).

            Example:
            Text: "yellow cup"
            Image: shows a yellow cup standing on a flat white plane -> NO: extra surface under the object.

            Instructions:
            - If the quality of generated asset is acceptable and faithfully represents the text, return "YES".

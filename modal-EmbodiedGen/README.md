> ***EmbodiedGen*** compiles language, images, and edit commands into **policy-ready 3D worlds** — physically plausible assets, large-scale scenes, and task-driven interactive environments, deployable across major simulators.

## Modal production fork

This fork keeps the upstream EmbodiedGen source layout intact. Modal-specific build, runtime,
control-plane, environment, patch, and regression-test code lives under [`modal/`](modal/README.md).
The Modal production source now targets EmbodiedGen v2.1.0. See `modal/UPSTREAM.md` for the
compatibility and validation status.

## ✨ What's New in V2

- 💬 **3D Vibe Coding** — build and edit sim-ready scenes through natural-language dialogue via Claude Code slash commands (`/embodiedgen:*`), each edit a bounded, physics-validated skill call.
- 🏠 **Large-scale scene generation** — multi-room, navigable, instance-editable houses at controllable complexity tiers (`minimalist` → `detail`).
- 📦 **One world, every simulator** — a standardized layout loads with consistent geometry, collision, and physics across **SAPIEN, Isaac Sim, Isaac Gym, MuJoCo, Genesis, and PyBullet**.
- 🧩 **Pluggable 3D backends** — switch between **SAM3D**, **TRELLIS**, and the **Hunyuan3D Pro** cloud API with a single flag.
- 🧥 **Beyond rigid bodies** — text-conditioned garments deploy as deformable meshes in Genesis.
- 🕹️ **Part-level affordance** — functional part segmentation, per-part semantics, and simulation-validated 6-DoF grasp poses for any generated asset.
- 🤖 **Closed-loop robot learning** — policies trained purely in EmbodiedGen-generated worlds transfer to real robots (task success **9.7 → 79.8%** in sim, **21.7 → 75.0%** on real robots, from [sim2real RL paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2603.18532)).

<h2 id="quick-start">🚀 Quick Start</h2>

```sh
git clone https://github.com/HorizonRobotics/EmbodiedGen.git
cd EmbodiedGen
git checkout v2.1.0
conda create -n embodiedgen python=3.10.13 -y
conda activate embodiedgen
# Manually install one CUDA toolkit when needed. cu126 remains the default.
# bash install.sh cu126 # RTX 40-series.
# bash install.sh cu128 # RTX 50-series / Blackwell.
conda deactivate && conda activate embodiedgen
bash install.sh basic # around 10 mins
```

Set up one GPT agent backend (required by most pipelines):

- **Azure OpenAI / OpenRouter:** select the backend and update its API key in
  `embodied_gen/utils/gpt_config.yaml`.
- **Codex CLI:** run `codex login`, then set `agent_type: codex` in
  `embodied_gen/utils/gpt_config.yaml`; no project API key is required.

See the [GPT Agent Setup guide](docs/documentation/gpt_agent.md) for complete
configuration, environment variables, and deployment recommendations.

Then generate your first sim-ready asset:

```sh
img3d-cli --image_path apps/assets/example_image/sample_00.jpg \
    --n_retry 2 --output_root outputs/imageto3d
# → outputs/imageto3d/sample_00/result: URDF + mesh(.obj/.glb) + 3DGS(.ply) + video
```

<h2 id="services">🖥️ Services — Local Gradio Apps</h2>

After installation, launch an interactive service and open its local URL:

```sh
python apps/image_to_3d.py    # http://localhost:8081
python apps/text_to_3d.py     # http://localhost:8082
python apps/texture_edit.py   # http://localhost:8083
python apps/visualize_asset.py  # http://localhost:8088
```

Models are downloaded automatically on first use. ➡️ [Service documentation](https://horizonrobotics.github.io/EmbodiedGen/docs/services/)

<h2 id="generate-assets">🧱 Generate — Sim-Ready 3D Assets</h2>

Turn a **single image** or a **text prompt** into a simulation-ready asset: metric geometry, convex collision proxy, VLM-inferred physical properties (scale, mass, friction), quality-checked with automatic retries — packaged as URDF + mesh + 3DGS.

<img src="docs/documentation/assets/image_to_3d.jpg" alt="Image to 3D" width="700">

```sh
# Image → 3D (backends: SAM3D | TRELLIS | HUNYUAN3D, via --image3d_model)
img3d-cli --image_path apps/assets/example_image/sample_01.jpg --output_root outputs/imageto3d

# Text → 3D (backends: SAM3D | TRELLIS | HUNYUAN3D, via --image3d_model)
text3d-cli --prompts "small bronze figurine of a lion" --output_root outputs/textto3d

# Re-texture an existing mesh (Chinese & English prompts)
texture-cli --mesh_path apps/assets/example_texture/meshes/horse.obj \
    --prompt "A gray horse head with flying mane and brown eyes" --output_root outputs/texture_gen
```

The same generate-and-export path reaches **soft bodies**: text-conditioned garments deploy as deformable meshes in Genesis.

Any generated URDF can be further annotated with **part-level affordances** — functional part segmentation, per-part semantics, and simulation-validated 6-DoF grasps (requires `bash install.sh affordance`):

```sh
affordance-cli --urdf-paths apps/assets/example_affordance/ear_hear/sample.urdf \
    --output-dirs outputs/affordance_annotation/ear_hear
```

<h2 id="scale-scenes">🏠 Scale — Large-Scale Scenes</h2>

Go beyond tabletops: generate **multi-room, navigable, instance-editable houses** as sim-ready backgrounds at a controllable complexity tier, or create photo-realistic **3DGS background scenes** from a text prompt.

<img src="docs/documentation/assets/worlds.gif" alt="Large-scale multi-room scenes" width="600">

```sh
# Room / house from a natural-language description (requires `bash install.sh room`)
room-cli -m embodied_gen.scripts.room_gen.gen_room \
    --output-root outputs/rooms --prompt "Wipe the table in a simple dining room"
# or specify the profile explicitly: --room-type Kitchen --seed 42 --complexity simple

# 3DGS background scene from text (requires `bash install.sh scene3d`)
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 scene3d-cli --prompts "Art studio with easel and canvas" --output_dir outputs/bg_scenes/ --seed 0
```

<h2 id="compose-worlds">🌍 Compose — Task-Driven Worlds</h2>

From a natural-language task description, EmbodiedGen parses a **scene graph** and composes a physically stable, directly loadable **interactive 3D world** — background, context objects, manipulated targets, distractors, and robot.

<h2 id="vibe-coding">💬 Edit — 3D Vibe Coding</h2>

Build and edit sim-ready 3D worlds **through dialogue**. EmbodiedGen ships a Claude Code plugin whose slash commands wrap the generation and spatial-computing skills — each instruction is a bounded, physics-validated skill call that preserves a deployable world state.

<img src="docs/documentation/assets/vibe_coding.gif" alt="3D Vibe Coding: editing a sim-ready world through dialogue" width="600">

```sh
bash install/install_agent_plugin.sh  # register the plugin in Claude Code
```

<h2 id="robot-learning">🤖 Train — Robot Learning</h2>

Generated worlds are not just viewable — they are **online training environments**. Spin up parallel `gym` environments from a generated layout, record sensor and trajectory data, and evaluate grasp quality of generated assets.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="docs/documentation/assets/parallel_sim.gif" alt="parallel_sim1" width="290"/></td>
    <td><img src="docs/documentation/assets/parallel_sim2.gif" alt="parallel_sim2" width="290"/></td>
  </tr>
</table>

```sh
# Parallel simulation environments from a generated layout
python embodied_gen/scripts/parallel_sim.py \
    --layout_file "outputs/layouts_gen/task_0000/layout.json" \
    --output_dir "outputs/parallel_sim/task_0000" --num_envs 16

# Grasp-quality evaluation of a generated URDF (ManiSkill + SAPIEN)
python embodied_gen/scripts/eval_collision_success.py \
    --urdf-path outputs/imageto3d/sample_00/result/sample_00.urdf --num-trials 4
```

In a companion [sim-to-real RL study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2603.18532), policies trained purely in EmbodiedGen-generated worlds reached **79.8%** simulation and **75.0%** real-robot task success.
